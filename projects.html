                <h2>How I started</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on using my HTML and CSS skill set. How did I learn so much in a short space of time? Well I studied also every day practicing coding and conceptualizing what my projects will be, then bringing them to life by creating them into a final end result. </p>

                <h2>The Journey continues</h2>
                <p>Even though I am pursing to be a WordPress web developer, the journey continues to improve my skillset and become a senior WordPress web developer by learning the in and outs of web development.</p>
