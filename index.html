<h2 id="section-title">About</h2>


<p>My educational background includes an ongoing Full Stack Web Developer Certification, where I am learning the ins and 
outs of web development, both front end and back end. I hold a certificate in Entrepreneurial Studies, where I gained 
valuable skills and knowledge related to starting, growing, and managing businesses. I also hold several Certificates in 
Information Technology, which gave me a solid understanding of computer hardware, networking, and software applications. 
Additionally, my diploma in Microsoft Office further enhanced my proficiency in essential office tools.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional and educational pursuits, I am an advocate for community service. I have volunteered my time on 
mission trips, contributing to the rebuilding of homes in Dominica after Hurricane Maria. I've also served as a camp counsellor, 
teaching information technology to young children while providing supervision and guidance.</p>

<p>My diverse skill set, coupled with my dedication to personal and professional growth, makes me a valuable asset in any role I undertake. 
I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve business processes and providing exceptional customer service to drive success in 
every endeavour.</p>
